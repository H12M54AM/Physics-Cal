There are 8 choices that allow a user to choose one of them and plug in the numbers while the application calculates them. These formulas are very basic and are from kinematics and a couple that is mixed. This is a super simple application. The formulas are:

* vf = vi + at
* d = ((vi + vf) / 2) * t
* d = vi*t + 0.5 * a * t^2
* vf^2 = vi^2 + 2 * a * d
* Work = Force * Displacement
* eff = (output / input) * 100
* Ei + W = Ef
* Torque = F * r

The Ei + W = Ef does not check if there is potential and kinetic energy but takes the full answer of Ei and/or Ef.
